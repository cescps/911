   The second production model to be made by the company after the Porsche 356, interestingly the 911 was originally called the 901. However, by the time the model went on sale it had become the 911 after a claim about naming rights from French car manufacturer, Peugeot. The 911 name not only stuck but has since become synonymous with success on both road and racetrack.
