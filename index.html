      Porsche AG is a German luxury and high-performance automobile manufacturer, headquartered in Stuttgart. The company, founded by Ferdinand Porsche in the 1930s, initially worked on creating the Volkswagen Beetle. Post-World War II, Ferdinand's son, Ferry Porsche, developed the first Porsche car, the 356. Today, Porsche is owned by Volkswagen AG, in which Porsche Automobil Holding SE has a controlling stake. Porsche's lineup includes the 718, 911, Panamera, Macan, Cayenne, and Taycan.

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
   As business boomed at Porsche, the numbers rose until the successor to the 356 led Porsche to end its use of this custom typology. 1964 saw the ‘Type 901’ launch, making its debut at the Paris Motor Show. After the show, however, an unforeseen issue came to light as Peugeot laid claim to the legal rights of using three-digit numbers containing a zero in the middle. Already mid-launch, the opportunity to create a new number had passed. With a typical display of Porsche ingenuity – and the ‘1’ typeface had already been designed for the new model – a decision was made to rename the vehicle ‘911’, and a legend was born. With models such as the 924, 928 and 944 joining the 911 over the ensuing years, the three-digit figure starting with a ‘9’ has become synonymous with the sporting character of the Porsche brand.

    718</span>.
  </h1>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
   The 911 model range is not the only numbered model in today’s Porsche line-up, of course. The 718 range comprises of the Boxster, Cayman and, yes, the Spyder. Its significance harks back to the legendary 718 mid-engine, four-cylinder racecar that first made its appearance at the 1957 24 Hours of Le Mans. Nowadays, the 718 is a mid-engine roadster that take the sporting spirit of that racing icon and transfers it to the roads of today.

<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold leading-tight mb-4">
    Cayenne</span>.
  </h1>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
   This unmistakable SUV powerhouse packs intense performance and precise dynamics – in other words just the kind of vehicle deserving of a name with a bit of a kick to it. When the Cayenne debuted in 2002 it became, at the time, the third model in the Porsche product line-up alongside the 911 and the Boxster. The name itself derives from the piquant cayenne pepper – a bold and relevant choice for this intrepid traveller with a fiery nature.

<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold leading-tight mb-4">
    Macan</span>.
  </h1>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
   When the Macan went on sale in 2015, people were immediately left scratching their heads about the provenance of the model’s name… unless you spoke Javanese, that is. The name comes from the language’s word for the Indonesian tiger and acknowledges the fierceness that lies beneath the car’s elegant exterior. The lively nature of the Macan is the reason why that today it’s universally considered the sportiest of compact SUVs.

<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold leading-tight mb-4">
    Panamera</span>.
  </h1>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
  It’s fair to say that Porsche owes a great debt to the legacy of the Carrera Panamericana, however short lived the now infamous race was. Besides the Carrera name we now associate with the 911, it’s also from where the Panamera got its name. The race, which was held in its original form between 1950 and 1954, was about endurance, speed and reliability – attributes you could easily describe this car with.

<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold leading-tight mb-4">
    Taycan</span>.
  </h1>

  <p class="text-lg mb-4">
  When it was launched in 2019, the first all-electric Porsche warranted a name worthy of its electrifying qualities. The word Taycan derives from two terms of Turkic origin, translating approximately to “soul of a spirited young horse”. It’s a phrase that epitomises the personality of the electric Porsche – lively, vigorous, agile, free-spirited and tireless. The name also reflects both the brand’s roots and its future simultaneously, with the ‘horse’ reference reminiscent of the iconic silhouette on the Porsche crest itself. Even since its launch, the word has taken on further positive associations across other languages. In Japanese, for instance, ‘taikan’ roughly means ‘physical experience’ – something you won’t fail to agree with once sat behind the wheel of the Taycan.
